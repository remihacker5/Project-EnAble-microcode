NOTES FOR PROJECT: EnAble v2.0

As of June 18, 2022, the SUCCESS 2022 Science and Engineering Project by Jeron Osguthorpe, has now been renamed to "Project: EnAble" (aka. Project: Enable All). 

As of June 18, 2022, the final version of Project: EnAble v2.0 has now been released. Because we were not keeping track over every change we made every time we did it,
the overall version is named v2.0. 

As of June 18, 2022, Project: EnAble has officially started, forms have been signed to start the project, as well as the research plan and research paper are now being
written. All information regarding the research will be available here. This project is open source, however, following open source laws, any use of this project for 
any other projects MUST give credit to Jeron Osguthorpe for the development of the project. All papers regarding the project and official documents are now avaible for 
both versions v1.0 and v2.0. The files for v1.0 however are not avaible as they were permanitally lost. This year we have learned from our mistakes from a couple years
ago and the project is stored in multiple clouds and physical devices to ensure security. More information regarding v3.0 is in the release notes. 

What is Project: EnAble v2.0? 
Project: EnAble v2.0's goal is to create a prosthetic hand that is affordable, while still being functional. Many prosthetics are super expensive, so with some 3D 
Desgining and programming, our goal was to create a prostheic hand that is/was much more functional than the previous year (v1.0). 

Changes with Project: EnAble v2.0 compared to v1.0
- New Hand Redesign (cannot post files due to copyright)
- Touch Sensors Activated 
- More development towards sensors 
- More functions introduced 
- Combination of sensor's theorized 
- Motor continuous movment 

I'm not going to go too far into detail about Project: EnAble v2.0. v3.0 will definitaly have more information, however, for v2.0, please see my research paper and
documents, as they have all the other information and citations for the project. 

Thank you to everyone who helped support Project: EnAble v2.0, it really means a lot to me. I am so happy that with this project, I got to go to ISEF and compete as a 
finalist. For this next year, I hope to be able to improve Project: EnAble and create a project that theorizes for more than just hands (prioritizes prosthetic hands tho)
Once again, thank you everyone who showed support and helped with the project. I hope to make v3.0 so much better!
