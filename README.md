--- CHANGE LOGS --- 

8.30.21
index.py is created to test the touch sensors. The touch sensors were purchased off of Amazon for 10 of them for about $8. The serial number for the sensors is TTP223 Sensor Module. The sensor module successfully works with the Raspbery Pi 3B+ 

8.31.21 - Part A: 
motors.py, microbit.py, motorspy2.py files were all crated to test certain funciton (look in directory). Remington came over to help program the sensors and the motors. Before he came over, I got all the sensors working and got it so that if the sensor goes off the motors move. We changed it with the help of Rem to make it so that it is now when the sensor is pressed the motor stops. All of this  is contained in motorspy2.py. We are trying to make it so that and "or" statement inside a while statement works. 

9.1.21
motorspy2.py alteration. Fixed the problem with getting both the sensors to stop the motor. Did this by changing it form an "or" statement to an "and" statement. For some reason, this works.

9.2.21 
Today we had science research because it is a Thurday. I realized in class that I only have 26 avaiable pins for the sensors and the motors at the same time. So I decided to put two sensors into one pin becasue as long as it can send an input to the raspberry pi, it should work. I have decided that I am just going to stick with the Raspberry Pi an the Micro:bit because I really don't want to have to convert everything from Python into Micro:Python becasue honestly that is just a pain. Everthing has been assigned its new pins and they are all contained inside of the new file that I made.

9.2.21
fixed a couple of spelling mistakes in README.MD. I did this mostly to see if I can use git and github correctly, before I make any big changes to the code.

9.2.21
Just barely added a bunch of Micro:Bit Serial codes. Here is the list 
Shake = 1 
Logo up = 2
Logo Down = 3
Screen Down = 4
Screen Up = 5
Tilt Left = 6
Tilt Right = 7
Freefall = 8
3G = 9
6G = 10
8G = 11 
A = 12
B = 13 
AB = 14 


12.14.2021
Changed the motors around in the code and fixed the sleep problem. The entire hand is now assembled, Just have to figure out where I want to put the motors. Other than that the project is pretty much done. It is supposed to be done by 12.16.2021...so I really need to hurry, but it should be all fine. Hopefully Rem can fix the code and get it to me soon. I also uploaded a "main.py" this is now the new main file. 

6.18.2022
As of June 18th of 2022, this is the final last edit of Project: EnAble v2.0. Project: EnAble v3.0 will now commence including the new forms for the science fairs that the project will be competing in, including the many different forms of the project. Past versions will be avaible in their respective folders. Thanks to everyone who was and is supporting me with this project, we ended up winning First Place in our local science fair, The Air Force award as well as the chance to go to Atlanta, Georgia for the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF 2022)!  

6.18.2022 - B 
As of June 18th of 2022, the forms for the 2023 year of the project have now been uploaded. The project goes from May 16th 2022 to whenever finished (must be before May 16th 2023). The research plan has also been uploaded for the 2023 project. The 2023 project is refered to as Project: EnAble v3.0. The number after the decimal will change later on in version notes, but the overall project for the year will be refereed to as "Project: EnAble v3.0". The project this year has now been completely opened up to OPEN SOURCE. Anyone can use the files within this project as long as they are following the licenses provided (see LICENCES). All forms and information regarding v1.0 are under the year "2021" however, the files are missing. This project is competing for the International Science and Engineering Fair under Jeron Osguthorpe. Please see more info under v3.0 release notes when it is released. License notes have been updated for the 2023 year.
